                    As part of my major, I’ve taken classes in Front-end Web Development, Behavioral Economics, Python, and much more – I’m proficient
                    in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, jQuery and p5.js, and I’m actively learning new languages like React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an experience standpoint, I’m currently interning as the Digital Officer for Drew’s Honeybees, where I’m managing a
                    team responsible for overhauling the company’s web footprint. So far, we’ve developed wireframe iterations based on
                    customer feedback, and soon we’ll be developing a fully customizable Shopify storefront. Beyond coding, I have previous
                    intern experience at the US Embassy in Beijing, developing economic analysis reports on various parts of the Chinese
                    economy, and before that, conducting research and analysis on small business policy implementation for Senator Cardin’s
                    office as part of the US Senate Small Business Committee.

                    I have a diverse skillset, I am driven and passionate about what I do, and if accepted to this internship I would
                    approach challenges meticulously and passionately. Don’t pick me as your intern because of what I currently know – pick
                    me because I have the drive and the passion to learn, implement, and scale what I don’t know! Thank you so much for your
                    time in reading this letter.

                    Dear NPR Visuals Team,
                </h2>
                <p class="page1">
                    Hi! I'm Kai Elwood-Dieu. Growing up, listening to NPR was a daily family activity, and whenever Kai Ryssdale came
                    on-air, my family would shout “it’s Kai!” – I suppose in some way I’m applying to this internship in part in the hopes
                    of being able to tell my family that I’m working at the same company as the (arguably more famous) Kai. Needless to say,
                    working at NPR has always been a dream for me.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    Last semester, I took a class taught by a frontend engineer at the New York Times, and I was inspired to explore the
                    connections between frontend development and journalism. I believe that visualizations, such as the NPR Visuals team’s
                    visualization of the Ellicott City floods, enhance journalistic storytelling and are essential to drive readership as
                    news outlets move online (it was especially powerful for me, a Bethesda MD resident). I love the challenges and creative
                    agency that come with web and front-end development, and I would be thrilled to combine my love for coding and
                    storytelling at NPR this Fall.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    So why am I qualified? Most importantly, I’m passionate about creating and improving the things I’m involved in. I’m a
                    quick language learner, whether it be a new Javascript library or Chinese (I’m fluent!). From an educational standpoint,
                    I’m majoring in Interactive Media and Business and minoring in Computer Science and Chinese at NYU Shanghai.

                    He was also an active member of group discussions and offered his fellow classmates constructive and positive feedback.
                    I was impressed with his ability to teach himself technologies not used in the classroom, but even more so that he was
                    motivated to learn them. He is a kind collaborator and will flourish when working with and learning from other
                    professionals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to my work with the New York Times, I understand the unique set of talents that is required for an engineer to work
                    within a news organization. I am certain that Kai’s enthusiasm for learning, considered thought process, and talent for
                    writing code would be an asset to your team. Most importantly, I know Kai would soak up everything he could from the
                    experience of working with you and will undoubtedly flourish in his future career because of it. Because of this, I
                    encourage you to pursue him as a candidate.
                </p>
