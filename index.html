                    So why am I qualified, and how would I contribute? Specifically, I believe that my experience with Scrollmagic and D3 will be helpful in developing interactive stories. My experience with web development will be helpful in designing layout and making sure stories are friendly to all browsers and screen sizes. My journalistic background (I was the business manager for my high school newspaper) will help me understand the newsroom workflow and important tasks. My experience working with APIs (in JavaScript and Python) with help with data analysis and data cleaning.

                <p>
                    I hold no false pretenses that I am the best coder, or the best with D3, etc. However, I think that more important to this position is my passion for creating and improving the things I’m involved in. I’m a quick language learner, whether it be a new Javascript library or Chinese (I’m fluent!). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a diverse skillset, I am driven and passionate about what I do, and if accepted to this internship I would
                    approach challenges meticulously and passionately. Thank you so much for your
                    time in reading this letter.

                    Dear NPR Visuals Team,
                </h2>
                <p class="page1">
                    Hi! I'm Kai Elwood-Dieu, and I’m passionate about creating interactive experiences and telling stories with data. In particular, I’m very interested in D3, and I’m currently taking a course online about building data visualizations with D3 – my most recent project, built with D3 and Scrollmagic, can be viewed <a href="https://kaielwood.github.io/D3/finalProject/">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    I recently stumbled upon data visualization and quickly fell in love with the combination of storytelling, design, and data. I have experience with a variety of languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, several CSS preprocessing libraries, Liquid, P5.js, and D3. I have <a href="https://www.notion.so/kaielwooddieu/Kai-Elwood-Dieu-s-Coding-Life-Documentation-e50a3862e1744aeb84fa85c556e507e5">a blog where I document my journey with D3</a>. I’ve also worked with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, Dimension, and InDesign.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    I’m excited by visualization and interactive news experiences because I think that they enhance journalistic storytelling and are essential to drive readership as news outlets move online. Visualizations allow readers to experience a story in more ways than one and can allow for radically new ways of storytelling. It’s the potential for creativity in storytelling and the importance of journalism in our democracy that get me excited to work in data graphics for NPR, and I would be thrilled to join the team. 
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    This opportunity would allow me to build up my experience with D3 and visualization in a professional setting and would give me real experience working on code in a newsroom. In the future, I hope to work in a newsroom on digital tools or visualization/interactive stories, and I think that this experience would be an invaluable step towards that goal.

                    He was also an active member of group discussions and offered his fellow classmates constructive and positive feedback.
                    I was impressed with his ability to teach himself technologies not used in the classroom, but even more so that he was
                    motivated to learn them. He is a kind collaborator and will flourish when working with and learning from other
                    professionals.

                    Due to my work with the New York Times, I understand the unique set of talents that is required for an engineer to work
                    within a news organization. I am certain that Kai’s enthusiasm for learning, considered thought process, and talent for
                    writing code would be an asset to your team. Most importantly, I know Kai would soak up everything he could from the
                    experience of working with you and will undoubtedly flourish in his future career because of it. Because of this, I
                    encourage you to pursue him as a candidate.
