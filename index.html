                    As part of my major, I’ve taken classes in Front-end Web Development, Behavioral Economics, Python, and much more – I’m
                    proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, jQuery and p5.js, and I’m actively learning new languages like React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From an experience standpoint, I’m currently interning as the Digital Officer for Drew’s Honeybees, where I’m working
                    with and managing a group of three interns to overhaul Drew’s Honeybees’ web footprint. So far, we’ve developed
                    wireframe iterations based on customer feedback, and soon I’ll be developing a custom Shopify storefront that will be
                    fully customizable using the Shopify UI. Beyond coding, I have experience working in multiple levels of federal
                    government. This past semester, I interned at the US Embassy in Beijing, and before that, I interned with Senator
                    Cardin’s office on the US Senate Small Business Committee.

                    I have a diverse skillset, I am driven and passionate about what I do, and if accepted to this internship I would
                    approach challenges meticulously and passionately. <em>Don’t pick me as your intern because of what I currently know – pick
                    me because I have the drive and the passion to learn, scale, and implement what I don’t know!</em> Thank you so much for your
                    time in reading this letter.

                    Hi! I'm Kai Elwood-Dieu, from Bethesda, Maryland. I’m fluent in Chinese, I’ve acted in several school plays, and I make
                    music in my free time. While none of these things might seem to pertain to this internship, I hope that if we’re going
                    to get to know each other, you’ll be interested in knowing a little bit more about me.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    Why am I applying for this internship? I’ve grown up listening to NPR, and more recently I’ve been sucked into coding,
                    particularly front-end development. Last semester, I took a class taught by a front-end developer for the New York
                    Times, which exposed me to the importance of front-end development in journalism. I was fascinated with the innovative
                    new technologies used to transform UX and drive readership as news outlets move online. I love the challenges and
                    creative agency that come with web and front-end development, and I would be excited to combine my love my coding and
                    news at NPR this summer.
                </p>
                <p class="page1">
                    So why am I qualified? I think the most important answer is that I’m passionate about creating and improving the things
                    I’m involved in. From an educational standpoint, I’m majoring in Interactive Media and Business at NYU Shanghai with
                    minors in Computer Science and Chinese.
